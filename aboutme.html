                I'm web designer & front-end developer with 7 years of professional experience. I'm interested in all kinds of visual communication, but my major focus is on designing web, mobile & tablet interfaces. I also have skills in other fields like branding, icon design or web development.
                            Earlier I was full-time freelancer for 6 years . Currently I'm working for little overgrown Ghana “start-up” called Geelabs as a Senior UI/UX designer Product designer.
